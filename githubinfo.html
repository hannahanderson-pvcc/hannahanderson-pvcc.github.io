    <ul>
        <li>Q. What is a version control system?<br>A. Version control, also known as versioning or source control, is the practice of managing changes to source code. Itâ€™s about keeping a detailed account of every modification made to the code, ensuring that these changes are both trackable and reversible.</li>
        <li>Q. What is Git?<br>A. a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).</li>
        <li>Q. What is Github?<br>A. GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code</li>
        <li>Q. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?<br>A. Git is a version control system used for tracking code changes locally, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and offers collaboration and project management tools.</li>
        <li>Q. Who started Github and how was it started?<br>A. GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett as a platform to simplify code collaboration and version control using Git.</li>

        <li>Commit- represents a specific snapshot of changes made to files in a repository, providing a record of modifications with a unique identifier and descriptive message.</li>
        <li>Fork- creates a personal copy of someone else's repository, allowing independent work and potential contributions without altering the original project.</li>
        <li>Pull requests- a proposal to merge changes from a forked repository into the original repository, enabling collaboration and code review before incorporating modifications.</li>
        <li>Workflows- predefined automated processes that define a set of actions triggered by specific events, streamlining development, testing, and deployment tasks within repositories.</li>
        <li>Issues- serve as a platform for tracking tasks, enhancements, bugs, or discussions within a repository, facilitating collaboration and organization among contributors.</li>
        <li>Raw button- enables the direct viewing of a file's content without any formatting or rendering, displaying the file as plain text or binary data.</li>
        <li>Blame button- displays the revision history of a file, attributing each line to the specific author and commit that introduced the change.</li>
