        <tr>
          <td>Operating system</td>
          <td> a software that manages the computer hardware. It provides appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Job queue</td>
          <td>a storage organization in which objects are ordered in a first-in, first-out fashion 1. In the context of operating systems, a job queue is used to hold a set of jobs that are waiting to be executed by the CPU. The jobs are collected in a single batch and then executed without further interaction with the user.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>FIFO</td>
          <td>a method for organizing the manipulation of a data structure (often, specifically a data buffer) where the oldest (first) entry, or “head” of the queue, is processed first1</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Interactive Processing</td>
          <td>a feature that allows a program being executed to carry on a dialogue with the user through remote terminals1.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Time-sharing</td>
          <td>a computing technique that allows multiple users to share a single computer’s resources simultaneously. It enables multi-tasking by a single user or enables multiple user sessions </td>
        </tr>
          <td>Multiprogramming</td>
          <td>an operating system that enables the computer system to run multiple programs simultaneously. The primary function of a multiprogramming system is to enhance the utilization of CPU by managing and arranging the task or processes</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Application software</td>
          <td>a type of software that is designed to perform specific tasks for the user 1. It is a set of programs that are designed to perform a specific function, such as word processing, accounting, or inventory management. Application software is different from system software, which is responsible for managing the computer’s resources and providing a platform for application software to run.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>System software</td>
          <td>"the software that controls the overall operation of a computer”. Examples of system software include operating systems such as Windows, UNIX, Mac OS, and Linux.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Utility Software</td>
          <td> refers to all systems and programs on a computer system that maintain its functionality. It includes components that assist the operating system to optimize, maintain, organize, and manage how it functions in all situations</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Graphical user interface (GUI)</td>
          <td>allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons instead of text. It also provides a brief history of GUI technology and its components</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Shell</td>
          <td>a special application that uses the kernel API in the same way as other application programs. It manages the user-system interaction by prompting users for input, interpreting their input, and then handling output from the underlying operating system, much like a read-eval-print loop (REPL).</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Kernel</td>
          <td>a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer’s physical hardware and the processes running on it. The kernel enables multiple applications to share hardware resources by providing access to CPU, memory, disk I/O, and networking.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Device driver</td>
          <td>a computer program that controls or operates a particular type of device that is attached to a computer or automaton.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>File manager</td>
          <td>a program that provides a user interface to work with files and directories. It allows users to create, delete, move, copy, rename, and search for files and directories1.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Memory manager</td>
          <td>a program that manages the allocation of memory space to programs and data. It is responsible for keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom, and allocating memory to processes when they need it. The memory manager also frees up memory when it is no longer needed, allowing it to be used by other processes.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Virtual Memory</td>
          <td>enables data that is in RAM and not currently being used to be transferred to the hard disk. This frees up room in RAM for other programs and data. When the data on the hard disk is needed again, any other unused data is transferred to the hard disk before the original data is transferred back to RAM.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Boot strapping</td>
          <td>the first piece of code that runs when a machine starts, and is responsible for loading the rest of the operating system. It is also used as a term for building a system using itself – or more correctly, a predecessor version.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>ROM</td>
          <td>a type of memory that is used to store data that cannot be modified or changed. It is a non-volatile memory, which means that the data stored in it is retained even when the power is turned off. The ROM is used to store the computer’s firmware, which is the software that is permanently programmed into the hardware. The firmware is responsible for controlling the computer’s basic functions, such as booting up and loading the operating system.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Deadlock</td>
          <td>a situation in which two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for one of the others to do something. In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Spooling</td>
          <td>a specialized form of multi-programming that is used to mediate between a computer application and a slow peripheral, such as a printer. It is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program, or the system. Data is sent to and stored in memory or other volatile storage until the program or computer requests it for execution. The term “spool” is technically an acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations online.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Super user (or administrator)</td>
          <td> a user account that has the highest level of access to a computer system. This account can perform any action on the system, including modifying system files, installing software, and changing user permissions.</td>
        </tr>
          <td>Multi-factor authentication</td>
          <td>an authentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication.</td>
