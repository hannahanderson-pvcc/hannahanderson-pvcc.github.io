                <h3>Passports and Visas</h3>
                <ul>
                    These parts of the law talk about passport crimes and what happens if someone does something wrong with passports or visas. They cover things like making fake passports or using them in the wrong way. People who break these rules might get fined or put in jail for up to 25 years, especially if it's connected to serious crimes like terrorism or drug trafficking. These laws are meant to stop and punish anyone doing illegal stuff with passports and similar papers.

                <h3>Aircraft</h3>
                <ul>
                    These laws are about keeping air travel safe. They talk about not pointing lasers at planes, flying drones too close to airports or other planes, and being honest when dealing with aircraft parts. If someone breaks these rules and puts others in danger, they can get fined or even go to jail. There are exceptions for certain authorized activities, but causing serious harm or danger around planes can lead to harsher punishments.
